## ✅ Summary

> This room introduced the basics of LAN (Local Area Networks), covering how devices communicate within the same network using switches, IPs, and routing. Also, ARP and DHCP

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- There are LAN topologies with their own pros and cons
- Subnetting is what you use to slice up network address to assign to devices
- ARP is what computer uses if it know the ip address of a devices and also wants to know the MAC, once it knows it, it will save it on its cache
- DHCP is when a device doesnt have an ip yet, it will inform the dhcp server via dhcp discover, the dhcp server offers an ip, the device requests that ip, then dhcp acknowledge that ip on that device (DHCP ACK)
